## Description
Store and view your passwords platform-independent with this PHP web application. Passwords are saved AES-encrypted in an MySQL database. You can create multiple vaults with different master passwords, e.g. for different departments in your company. Inside of vaults you can group passwords entries.

## Setup
### Server
To set up this web app you need a database (MySQL) server and an Linux-based apache webserver running PHP 7.
  1. Copy all files into a directory of your choice.
  2. Edit "database.php" and enter your MySQL connection credentials.
  3. Open the "setup.php" file in your webbrowser to create the required tables in your database.
  4. Open the directory in your webbrowser (the webserver will serve the index.php file to you). Thats it. You can now log in on the "Manage Vaults" page with the management passwort you haven chosen in the previous step and create a vault. After that, you can open this newly created vault and store your passwords.
  5. It is highly recommended to use HTTPS instead of HTTP! Set up your webserver appropriate.
  6. (Optional) You can set your preferred language as default language in "global.php" file.

### Client
  - Chrome/Chromium, Firefox, Opera (both desktop and mobile)
  - IE/Edge not tested yet
